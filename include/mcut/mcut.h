Steiner points are necessary to allow the segments to exist in the mesh while maintaining the Delaunay property. This Delaunay property follows from the definition of a "Delaunay triangulation": the Delaunay triangulation is the triangulation such that, if you circumscribe a circle around every triangle, none of those circles will contain any other points. Alternatively, the Delaunay triangulation is the triangulation that “maximizes the minimum angle in all of the triangles.”. Steiner points are not inserted to meet constraints on the minimum angle and maximum triangle area. MCUT computes a CDT of a given connected component starting only from the faces that have more than three vertices. Neighbouring (triangle) faces will also be processed (i.e. refined) if their incident edges are split as a result of performing CDT on the current face. */
